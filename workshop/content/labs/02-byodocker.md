### Bring your own Docker

It's easy to get started with OpenShift whether you're using our app templates or bringing your existing docker assets. In this quick lab we will deploy an application using an exisiting docker image. OpenShift will create an image stream for the image as well as deploy and manage containers based on that image. And we will dig into the details to show how all that works.
<br>
<br>
When going through this lab, follow either Option 1 (CLI Instructions) or Option 2 (Web Console Instructions).
#### Let's point OpenShift to an existing built docker image
<br>

##### CLI Instructions (Option 1)

Run the following command inside the terminal: 
```execute
oc new-app sonatype/nexus:oss
```

Your output from the command above should be *similar* to the following: 

```
--> Found Docker image adffc23 (13 days old) from Docker Hub for "sonatype/nexus:oss"
    * An image stream tag will be created as "nexus:oss" that will track this image
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "nexus"
    * Port 8081/tcp will be load balanced by service "nexus"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "nexus"
    * This image declares volumes and will default to use non-persistent, host-local storage.
      You can add persistent volumes later by running 'volume dc/nexus --add ...'
--> Creating resources ...
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "nexus" created
    deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "nexus" created
    service "nexus" created
--> Success
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose svc/nexus' 
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
```
##### Web Console Instructions (Option 2)

On the left side of the Web Consolde, click on the Administrator drop down, and click on Developer

![devview](images/lab2_workshop_developer_view.png)

In the Developer View, click on the "+Add" tab to show the different options to deploy a workload: 

![devadd](images/lab2_workshop_dev_add_workload.png)

Click the "Container Image" option and next to Image Name enter "sonatype/nexus:oss", then click the magnifying glass to the far right to search for the image.

![nexusdeploy](images/lab2_workshop_deploy_nexus.png)

Scroll down, uncheck "Create a route to the application" under Advance Options, and click "Create". The topology tab should automatically come up, if not click on Topology on the left hand tab. 
You should see an object labeled nexus in your topology.

#### Browsing our Project Details
<br>

##### CLI Instructions (Option 1)

Switch back over to the terminal tab in your lab

<br>

Try typing the following to see what is available to 'get':
```execute
oc get all
```

<br>

Now let's look at what our image stream has in it:
```execute
oc get is
```

<br>

Getting more information from the nexus image stream: 
```execute
oc describe is/nexus
```

<br>

> ! An image stream can be used to automatically perform an action, such as updating a deployment, when a new image, in our case a new version of the nexus image, is created. 

<br>

##### Web Console Instructions (Option 2)
Similarly, you can also see the same details in the Web Console

Navigate back to the Administrator view in the Web Console. Scroll down, click on "Builds" on the left hand tab, then click on "Image Streams" 

![imagestream](images/lab2_workshop_nexus_topology.png)

Click on nexus and you should see something similar to this: 

![isinfo](images/lab2_workshop_nexus_is_info.png)

#### Accessing your Nexus App
<br>

##### CLI Instructions (Option 1)

When you created your Nexus Application, one of the default options was to automatically created route for the application, but we unchecked that. 

So what we can do is run this command in the CLI to create a route to our Nexus Application by exposing the service already running:

```execute
oc expose service nexus
```

The resource will be created for the route, then you can run this command to get the url to access your nexus application:
```execute
oc get route nexus
```

The output should be something similar to this:
```
NAME    HOST/PORT                                                       PATH   SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
nexus   nexus-demo-tonybo.apps.us-east-1.starter.openshift-online.com          nexus      8081-tcp                 None
```

Your route should be nexus-%project_namespace%.%console_url%

<br>

##### Web Console Instructions (Option 2)

In the Administrator view, navigate to the Networking Tab on the left hand side, expand it and click on "Routes":

![routes](images/lab2_workshop_create_route.png)

Name your route "nexus". In the Service dropdown, select Nexus. In the Target Port dropdown select 8081->8081 (TCP): 

![nexusroute](images/lab2_workshop_nexus_route_info.png)

Leave everything else as the default, scroll down, and click "Create". Your route information should show up as a url under location on the right side: 

![routecreated](images/lab2_workshop_nexus_route_created.png)

<br>

#### Test out the Nexus WebApp Route

Click on the url and open into a new tab or navigate to the route you exposed in the terminal from before

> nexus-%project_namespace%.%console_url%

You should encounter this error:

![nexuserror](images/lab2_workshop_nexus_error.png)

Good work - this error is expected; since the nexus source directory is actually is on /nexus

So navigate to the same url but add /nexus at the end, like this:

> nexus-%project_namespace%.%console_url%/nexus

Of course, we have not provided persistent storage; so, any and all work will be lost.

![nexusconsole](images/lab2_workshop_nexus_webapp_console.png)

<br>

#### Let's clean this up

Navigate to the terminal tab in your workshop and run the following command:
```execute
oc delete all --all
```

<br>

#### Summary

In this lab you've deployed an example docker image, pulled from docker hub, into a pod running in OpenShift. You exposed a route for clients to access that service via thier web browsers. And you learned how to get and describe resources using the command line and the web console. Hopefully, this basic lab also helped to get you familiar with using the CLI and navigating within the web console.
